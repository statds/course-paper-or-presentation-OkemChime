\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


%The introduction is used to a refernce framework for the reader. 
%The aim of this section is to answer three questions:
%Why is the topic important/interesting?
%What has been done on this topic in the literature?
%What is your contribution?


For many people in the world, sports are more than simple games or recreational
activities, forming a significant part of our lives and culture. For hundreds of
years sports have acted as a tool to transcend the boundaries of geography,
language and culture. Global sporting events such as the Olympic games and the
World Cup assert the significance of sport in unifying people worldwide.
Finacially, the sports industry is a powerhouse, with signifcant economic and
social impacts. It drives revenue, tourism and job oppportunities, making it a 
critical componenet of many nation's economies. 

Performance data is a large and constantly growing field of data science. With
so many aspects of professional sport that can be analyzed, sport is an 
extremely relevant domain where data science techniques can be applied in order
to give players and teams a potential edge. Soccer is the most popular sport in
the world with more than 3.5 billion fans around the globe and over 250 million
players in over 200 countries.

Amongst this, the English Premier League is the most watched sports league in
the world with a potential viewership of over 4.7 billion people. 
With so much attention focused specfically on this league,
players, coachhes, fans sponsors and more are dependent on the success of the
league as a whole as well as how specific teams and players are performing.

This is where data science through in the form of sports performance analysis 
which has revolutionized the world of sport by adding a new layer to the
sporting world- offering insights which were previously unimaginable. 
comes in as a tool to amalgamate information,
These  statistical insights can guide decisions that can make all the difference 
at all levels of the game; all the way from the players on the pitch to the fans
in the stadium.

There has been recent work done by \citet{goes2021unlocking} which takes into 
account the importance of big data data in the professional soccer setting. 
With the increase in technology available to professional soccer players we have
seen the use of wearable position tracking devices which have been widely 
adopted by professional sports organizations with the understanding that they
could be a game changer in the world of high peformance sport. The focus of this 
work focuses more on the tactical implications of this type of data whereas
our research will be more focused on how performance data can be used to guide
decisions about players.

Some interesting work was also done that used performance data as a metric to 
determine player value. This study looked at s variety of factors in order to 
determine player value. Some of these metrics included on-field statistics and
other fairly obvious factors such as discipliniary record and injuries as well
less obvious variables such as image rights and personal background etc 
\citep{tunaru2010valuations}. This study like ours, uses OPTA data to look
evaluate performance at a player level in order to help formulate decisions on
players. However, this study incorporates off-field metrics as well as  objective
peformance data to inform their financial evulations on players whereas our
study will be only based on objective on field performance data and will attempt
to provide more insights into their current level of performance as well as
their predicted future level of performance.
