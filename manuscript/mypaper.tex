\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


%The introduction is used to a refernce framework for the reader. 
%The aim of this section is to answer three questions:
%Why is the topic important/interesting?
%What has been done on this topic in the literature?
%What is your contribution?


Performance data is a large and constantly growing field of data science. With
so many aspects of professional sport that can be analyzed, sport is an 
extremely relevant domain where data science techniques can be applied in order
to give players and teams a potential edge. Soccer is the most popular sport in
the world with more than 3.5 billion fans around the globe and over 250 million
players in over 200 countries.

Soccer is the most popular sport in
the world with more than 3.5 billion fans around the globe and over 250 million
players in over 200 countries. Amongst this, the English Premier League is the 
most watched sports league in the world with a potential viewership of over 4.7 
billion people. With so much attention focused specfically on this league,
players, coachhes, fans sponsors and more are dependent on the success of the
league as a whole as well as how specific teams and players are performing.

This is where data science comes in as a tool to amalgamate information,
provide statistical insights and guide decisions that can make all the difference 
at all levels of the game; all the way from the players on the pitch to the fans
in the stadium.

There has been recent work done by \citet{goes2021unlocking} which takes into 
account the importance of big data data in the professional soccer setting. 
With the increase in technology available to professional soccer players we have
seen the use of wearable position tracking devices which have been widely 
adopted by professional sports organizations with the understanding that they
could be a game changer in the world of high peformance sport. The focus of this 
work focuses more on the tactical implications of this type of data whereas
our research will be more focused on how performance data can be used to guide
decisions about players.
